## Editor-in-Chief

**Alaia**  
Founder, Editor, and Servant of the People (为学生服务的善良编辑)

Alaia is a kind-hearted editor devoted to serving the public through structured expression, formal tone, and unapologetic style.  
With no claim to authority beyond sincerity and taste, Alaia believes that presentation itself is a form of meaning.

This journal exists because Alaia believes that **things should have style** — even when they are unnecessary, unfinished, or slightly ridiculous.

## Editorial Philosophy

J. PENIS 格调 is not driven by metrics, rankings, or recognition.  
It is driven by **格调**.

Here, *格调* means:

- Taking form seriously, even when content is playful  
- Writing with confidence, even without conclusions  
- Presenting ideas as proceedings, simply because it feels right  
- Valuing tone, structure, and attitude over outcomes  

This journal does not ask whether something is useful.  
It asks whether it is **done with style**.
